## 📘 Problem Statement

The **Roots Blower** is a critical component in various **industrial applications** such as pneumatic conveying, wastewater aeration, and ventilation systems.  

However, it often suffers from:
- Reduced efficiency  
- Higher energy consumption  
- Increased mechanical wear and breakdowns  

The goal of this project was to **analyze**, **design**, and **optimize** the performance of a Roots Blower to ensure:
- Improved energy efficiency  
- Enhanced reliability  
- Reduced mechanical stress  
- Better operational performance  

---

## 🎯 Objective

To **design a Roots Blower** that ensures steady airflow and improved mechanical efficiency through optimized geometry, better material selection, and precise synchronization of the lobes.

## ⚙️ Theory

A **Roots Blower**, also known as a *Roots Pump* or *Roots Compressor*, is a **positive displacement rotary pump** that transfers air or gas using a pair of synchronized interlocking rotors (lobes).  

### 🔹 Working Principle
- Two lobed rotors rotate **in opposite directions**.  
- The lobes trap air at the inlet and carry it around the casing to the outlet.  
- As the lobes rotate, the trapped volume is displaced, generating **a continuous and pulsation-free flow of air**.  
- The gears on the shafts ensure **precise synchronization** of the rotors to prevent contact.  

Roots blowers are known for their:
- **Simplicity and reliability**  
- **Steady flow characteristics**  
- **Low maintenance requirements**  

They are widely used in **low-to-moderate pressure applications**, although they are less efficient compared to high-speed centrifugal compressors.

## 🧩 Construction Details

### 🧱 Housing
- The **outer casing** (housing) is designed to **accommodate all internal components** securely.  
- It allows **easy fluid flow** and **mounting to other machines** in an assembly line.  

### ⚙️ Impellers
- Two **four-lobed impellers** rotate in opposite directions.  
- Each impeller is mounted on a **shaft** connected to a **pair of meshing gears** that synchronize rotation.  

### ⚙️ Gears
- Used for **power transmission and synchronization** of the lobes.  
- Prevents direct contact between the impellers, minimizing wear.  

### 🔩 Fasteners
- **Hex flange bolts** are used to securely connect the **housing and back cover**, ensuring rigidity and preventing leakage.  

### 🛡️ Back Cover
- Acts as a **protective shield** for the impellers.  
- Prevents dust, debris, or foreign particles from entering the mechanism.
